## Install

You'll ideally need something to run a web server on the root of this repo.

I'd suggest [Python 2.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Dev environment

Once you have Python 2.x installed, run the following:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then visit [localhost:8000](https://localhost:8000)
